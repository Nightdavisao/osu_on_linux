# osu_on_linux
An easy osu! installer for Linux platform using the frontend PlayOnLinux
## This isn't being maintained anymore
Please use other scripts to install osu!, it's better than using this script because PlayOnLinux sucks at installing additional packages.

This wasn't being maintained for a while since I don't use Linux anymore, due to splitting my HDD partition to install Ubuntu in dualboot isn't really convincing for me to use Linux in small partition space.
